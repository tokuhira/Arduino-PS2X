# Arduino-PS2X Library
Want to interface a PlayStation 2 Controller with an Arduino Microcontroller? You have come to the right place. 

Arduino-PS2X is an easy to use library that will take care of all the low-level interfacing for you, so you can start using the controller right away in your project.

Please refer to the example sketches to learn how to use this library.

## Wiring the Controller
The seemingly most notorious part prone to errors is wiring the controller to the Arduino. Follow the pinout in the following picture from the [amazing CuriousInventor PS2 Interface Guide](https://store.curiousinventor.com/guides/PS2):

**You are advised not to rely on wire colors, but rather on pin positions**. The wires in the image come from an official Sony controller, I expect their colors to be fairly consistent among all Sony controllers, but you shouldn't really trust them.

Lynxmotion sells [this nice breakout connector](https://www.robotshop.com/en/ps2-connector-breakout-board.html) which makes things much easier.

## Debugging
If you have problems, open the PS2X_lib.h file and change (i.e.: remove the comment markers):
```
// $$$$$$$$$$$$ DEBUG ENABLE SECTION $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
// to debug ps2 controller, uncomment these two lines to print out debug to uart

//#define PS2X_DEBUG
//#define PS2X_COM_DEBUG
```
to:
```
// $$$$$$$$$$$$ DEBUG ENABLE SECTION $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
// to debug ps2 controller, uncomment these two lines to print out debug to uart

#define PS2X_DEBUG
#define PS2X_COM_DEBUG
```
to enable debug messages. Save the file and recompile the example sketch. Open the serial terminal and see what it says.
